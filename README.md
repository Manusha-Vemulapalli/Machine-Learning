Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning has three different types of algorithms. They are:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semisupervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

Stages of building a machine learning algorithm from scratch:

1. Research/Gathering Data
2. Data Preparation
3. Building the model
4. Train and test your model
5. Model optimization and evaluation
6. Experiment tracking
7. Model Deployment
